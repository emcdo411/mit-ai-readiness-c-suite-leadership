### üß† Human Context Preamble Prompt ("Prompt Before the Prompt")

Before initiating your executive AI Readiness Report, run this preamble to surface the unstated goals, hidden concerns, and collaboration dynamics that define your C-suite culture. This preamble prompt is designed to elicit human nuance before introducing technical frameworks.

**Prompt:**

You are helping a senior strategist prepare a tailored AI Readiness Report for a C-suite audience. Before evaluating technical maturity, ask three human-first diagnostic questions to uncover hidden intentions, concerns, and collaboration dynamics. Base your summary on these real responses:

---

**1. What‚Äôs the Unstated Goal of each leader?**

* The **CTO** wants stakeholders to take AI seriously ‚Äî not just for task automation, but as a strategic intelligence tool that can help build best-in-class platforms and close customer experience gaps faster.
* The **COO** wishes people understood that the global AI wave has already arrived ‚Äî and that now is the time to scale before they fall behind. He sees AI as the Internet of our time.

**2. What‚Äôs the Hidden Fear?**

* The **CTO** is worried non-technical stakeholders will experience "sticker shock" ‚Äî overwhelmed by what AI can do and afraid of the investment required.
* The **COO** is concerned that without internal champions, the initiative will stall or get dismissed as another tech fad.

**3. What‚Äôs the Cultural Landscape?**

* The leadership team is aligned in principle and excited about AI‚Äôs potential. But they‚Äôre exhausted and overwhelmed by their existing workloads. They all believe AI tools can amplify their concerns, make invisible labor visible, and help surface solutions faster ‚Äî but they need help translating that excitement into momentum.

**Now generate this:**

Using that human context, write a short preamble that can be used to **kick off a strategic AI planning session** or **anchor the executive summary** of the full readiness report. It should be candid, actionable, and written as if a senior strategist is briefing the C-suite before showing them the dashboard.

Close with this sentence:

**‚ÄúNow that we‚Äôve seen the context clearly, let‚Äôs explore what an AI-powered operating model might look like ‚Äî not just in theory, but within *this* leadership culture.‚Äù**
